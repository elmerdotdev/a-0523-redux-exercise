# React JS - useReducer Exercise

- Convert all instances of `useState` into a Redux store
- When decreasing font size, add a condition to your *reducer* so that it doesn't go below 1px
- Omit/remove `filterNumbers` function and add the logic instead inside a *reducer*
- You can have multiple reducers if you want
- Final code should not have any `useState` hooks

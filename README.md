# React JS - Redux Exercise

- Remove all props
- Convert all instances of `useState` into a Redux store
- When decreasing font size, add a condition to a reducer action so that it doesn't go below 1px
- Omit/remove `filterNumbers` function and add the logic instead inside a reducer action
- You can have multiple slices if you want
- Final code should not have any `useState` hooks nor props

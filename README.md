# React JS - useReducer Exercise

- Convert all instances of `useState` into ONE Redux store
- When decreasing font size, add a condition on your *reducer* function so that it doesn't go below 1px
- Omit/remove `filterNumbers` function and add the logic instead inside the *reducer*
- Final code should not have any `useState` hooks
